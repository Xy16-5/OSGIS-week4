# Lab 2

#### Part 1: Plotting with external data (ajax calls)

In [part1-ajax-calls.js](js/part1-ajax-calls.js), you are asked to grab
one of three datasets we have provided via [a dataset
repository](https://github.com/CPLN692-MUSA611-Open-Source-GIS/datasets/tree/master/json)
on the class github account. Simply make a request for the data and
log the successful result to console. *Remember to use AJAX!*

Hint: github allows you to view the raw (unstyled) version of any file. Use this
to find the appropriate URL for AJAX, otherwise you'll grab the HTML document
which contains the *styled* JSON. This is not what we want!


#### Part 2: Application state: storing and removing information

In [part2-app-state.js](js/part2-app-state.js), you will be
tasked with writing a function for creating, adding, and removing (or
resetting) markers from the map based on data retrieved from the internet.
This task will require that you keep track of the markers somehow.

Hint: look to the bottom of the file to see how these functions are used

#### Part 3: Full application with user input

In [part3-application.js](js/part3-application.js), you will use
what you've learned thus far in the course to write a full application
with working user input. The user input portion of the task is handled
for you — all you need to do is define the appropriate functions which
are called from code that we've written. Once you've appropriately
defined the `resetMap`, `getData`, and `plotData` functions we've
provided, you should have a fully functioning application complete with
user input. Be sure to look through all the part3 `js` files to get a
sense of how the pieces work.

In particular, look at the variables that are being set in `main.js` and
think about how function scope is being used.
